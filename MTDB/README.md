#Movie Trailer Database (MTDB)

### Introduction
I wrote server-side code to store a list of favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. Then this data is served as a web page allowing visitors to review the movies and watch the trailers.
    
### Requirements
- Python
- PyGame library
- Python webbrowser library
- Python re library

### Installation
- Open fresh_tomatoes.html if already generated.
- Else generate fresh_tomatoes.html by running fresh_tomatoes.py which also opens it in a browser.
