#Battle City Tank

### Introduction
My project is inspired by simple childhood game named tank shooting. I have a castle in my game and some bad guys are trying to destroy the
castle. There is a hero who has to save castle from bad guys. The player has command of hero. Hero has a tank and will try to shoot enemy will his tank. 
      
 There are different levels of difficulties. As your score increases, difficulties increases. Difficulties include more number of bad guys as well as faster speed of bad guys. There is also a health meter which decreases as enemy hits tank or castle. After every level increase health meter is restored to full. But when health meter becomes zero player will lose the game. 

To operate the game player can use mouse and keyboard. Arrow keys are used to move tank up,down, left and right. Space key is used to shoot and mouse is used to rotate the tank. Level change pauses the game to let player relax. The next level starts only after player clicks mouse button. This game also has a background sound effect which helps player to concentrate.
